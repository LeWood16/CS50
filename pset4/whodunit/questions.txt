1.  What is stdint.h?

stdint.h is a head file in the C standard library; It allows programmers to write more portable code by providing
a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, together with the minimum and maximum allowable values
for each type, using macros.

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

These are integer types with a specific size; The 'u' at the beginning of these data types means unsigned, meaning 
it cannot be a negative value.  All of these data types denote integers, but the 8, 32, etc represent whatever integer
value for that particular machine is precisely 8 bits, or 32 bits, etc. So these types allow for a greater degree 
of control in what values are being used in your program.

3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

A DWORD has 4 bytes, LONG has 4 bytes, and a WORD has 2 bytes.

4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to 
identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

'0x'

5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

bfSize is the size of the whole bmp file, which includes the headerfiles, while biSize is the size of the
BITMAPINFOHEADER header file. biSize is constant and it equals 14 bytes

6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB and its origin is the lower-left corner. If biHeight is 
negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.

7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

biBitCount

8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

The user might not have entered those arguments in via the console.


9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

We're only reading one file at a time in this case BITMAPFILEHEADER.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

3; RGB triple is 3 bytes, times the bi.biwidth is 9, modulo 4 is 1, modulo 4 again is 1, 4 minus 1 is 3;

11. What does fseek do?

fseek sets the file position (use when you want to change the offset of the file pointer fp.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?

This is an integer constant which, when used as the whence argument to the fseek or fseeko function, 
specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position.
