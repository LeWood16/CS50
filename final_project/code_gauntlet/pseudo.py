# project goals

    # to be a go-to learning tool for budding programmers to prepare for intensive interviews
    
    # to help cure the epidemic of programmers who can't write their own code
    
    # to not only be in JavaScript, but also Python, C++, and Ruby
    
    # to be open-source, and easily scalable so others can contribute drills to the codebase
    
    # can pull from any source of programming/CS questions from around the internet, so long
    # as the sources have been properly accredited
