# project goals

    # to be a go-to learning tool for budding programmers to prepare for intensive interviews
    
    # to help cure the epidemic of programmers who can't write their own code
    
    # to not only be in JavaScript, but also Python, C++, and Ruby
    
    # to be open-source, and easily scalable so others can contribute drills to the codebase
    
    # can pull from any source of programming/CS questions from around the internet, so long
    # as the sources have been properly accredited 
    
# goals for beta

    # have layout template designed, both in jinja and html/css

    # difficulty settings
        
        # easy 
            
            # have so much time per question that you're able to google the answer, copy/paste, go
            # grab a coffee and come back in time to submit (15-20 mins)
            
        # medium
        
            # have time to google if you're good at searching, but still need to beat feet if
            # you've never done anything like this question before
            
        # hard
        
            # you have no time for googling/stackoverflowing; if you haven't done this
            # before, or if you're not quick on your feet, you'll run out of time
            
        # ability to set time per question not in beta, but will put in production app;
        
        # beta difficulty setting only changes the time per question; how subjectively hard
        # the question is will be up to open-sourcing, probably put to a community vote
    
    # have timer setup
       
        # timer is set with the difficulty rating (i.e. time per question) from index page before starting session
        
        # show user total time remaining (question time * number of questions) on each question screen
        
        # show total time allotted on index page before user clicks "start"
        
        
    
# THIS POMODORO:

# create an object to push to server, to grab the neccessary questions

# once everything is selected, all the selection divs fade away, and a countdown from 3 
# starts; then the first question fades in;
