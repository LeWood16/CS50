# DND Character Sheet Generator

    # takes input from user via form
    
        # user can focus tabs (races and classes) by clicking on them
        
        # randomizes what needs to be filled out when user didn't fill in 
        # (w/ user's permission)
        
        # user can submit form at any time to randomize the unfilled out parts 
        # (to speed the character creation along)
        
    # scrubs a DND wiki for class & race data
    
        # probably via API
    
        # only basic classes and races
    
        # scales stats via level
    
        # shows user what to fill in where if they don't want to print out values on sheet
        
    # generates PC sheet in PDF format
    
        # give users the option for either a traditional or a simplified character sheet
        
        # allow users to keep sheet in their browser cache, so they can update it as they play
        
        # think about generating things like gear lists, carrying capacity, feats (and their requirements)
        # and spells; consider putting some things in browser frontend so site can be used
        # offline
